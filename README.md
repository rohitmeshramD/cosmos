        The above image depicts the star and planets that make up our solar system. There are total of 9 planets including earth in this system. Some planets are the size of our moon, whereas some planets are so large that thousands of earth can fit into them! Now our star, 'The Sun' is so large that even all planets combined and multiplied by 1000 will easily fit inside it. Now thats BIG.

        But this is just the tip of iceberg. Now out there in space there of millions of such 'stars' which are much bigger than our sun, various other solar systems, planets, comets, black holes etc.
